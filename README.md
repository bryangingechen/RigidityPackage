RigidityPackage is a Mathematica Package including functions for analyzing rigidity properties of spring networks (periodic and non periodic) in any dimension.  It can draw pictures of frameworks in 2D and 3D, compute rigidity (compatibility) matrices for frameworks in arbitrary dimension, and includes many tools for constructing frameworks.

### How do I get set up? ###

Please see the notebook `Rigidity_package_demo.nb` for demonstrations of the functionality. The code should work in Mathematica 9 and above, maybe below as well.
